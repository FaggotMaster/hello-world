# hello-world
First time creating a github repository

I have to say I'm nervous about all this.
I've wanted to be a progammer since high school and now I'm in college working towards my degree.
While I work on my degree I thought I would practice making games on UE4 and Unity and since every programmer in the world uses
github as a way to share their work I thought it would be a good idea if I got comfortable using this site too.
